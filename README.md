Context:  
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. This Machine Learning project is an attempt to differentiate such fraud transactions from the genuine ones using a dataset containing about 284000 credit card transactions with anonymized variables.
